<h1><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></h1>
Spotted lantern flies reproduce at an extremely rapid rate (with one adult female laying up to 3 egg masses in her lifetime, each containing 30-60 eggs) allowing their population to grow exponentially within a single season. SLF’s feed on sap, weaken vines, reduce cold hardiness, and can cause plant death. <br>

Impact: By focusing on reducing their ability to reproduce, we can ensure that there will be less SLFs to cause harm to grape vines, satisfying our clients. Our product could also be used outside of the vineyards, as SLFs lay eggs anywhere and everywhere they can. Developing a selective solution allows us to create a scalable model that can be implemented; By having a larger user base, we can make more of an impact on the SLF population, targeting and removing egg masses which are the root source of the infestation! <br>


<b>Concept A: Radial Compression Mechanism</b><br>
A mechanical tool designed to destroy egg masses directly on grapevines without damaging the plant. The device consists of a circular frame with a slit that surrounds the vine and positions a set of radially arranged claws around the egg mass. These claws are connected to a manual lever mechanism that converts the input force into inward radial motion. As the lever is pulled, the claws close uniformly around the egg mass, applying compressive force sufficient to crush and destroy the eggs.
