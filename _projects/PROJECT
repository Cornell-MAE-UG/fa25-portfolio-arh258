<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b>

This project involved designing a linear actuator for a statics application. My design is intended to lift the maximum amount of weight to a theoretical height with certain requirements on the design.

<b>CONSTRAINTS/OBJECTIVES</b>
-Must fit without a 150x50 cm design space
-Must use 3 pins (2 pinned to the ground)
-Must involve a linear actuator
-Must optimize lifting height<br>

<b>DESIGN DEGREES OF FREEDOM</b>
We had to choose how to make the design, what type of actuator to use, and how long the bar was<br>

<b>STATIC ANALYSIS</b>
By setting the mechanism to equilibrium, one can see that the Moment balence implies that a greater torque would come from further distance from the rotating axis. In order to maximize this torque for purposes of the linear actuator, I placed the linear actuator at the furthermost part from the rotating axis. I then chose the RSX linear actuator to maximize this torque. By geometric analysis, one can see that the longer the beam, the higher the theoretical height achieved could be. Therefore, the beam should be as long as possible within the constraints (150cm) to lift the weight to the heighest value.<br>

<h3><b>MAX DEFELCTION</b></h3>
less than 2% length deflection (under 0.03m) <br>
<b>Design Choices</b>
Cross Section: W150x18
Material: Rolled Steel

<h3>Deflection Analysis</h3>
<b>Assumptions</b><br>
Assumes: the weight of the beam itself to be modelled by the distributed loading, the weight applied to the beam to be modelled by a point load, the force of the actuator to be modelled by a pin to allow the pin-pin set up, assumes the beam to be weightless to ease I calculations

The max deflection occurs halfway through the beam and is modeled by the distrbuted load pinned-pinned beam in appendix B. This model assumes that the linear actuator's load can be modelled by the reaction for in the right roller given the beam is in static equilibrium. Therefore, the whatever weight is applied to the beam can be modelled by a point load halfway through the beam. The weight of the beam can be modelled by the dsitrbuted load and the superposition of these elements result in the max deflection (which occurs at the same spot halfway through the beam). Delta (max)= -5wL^4/384EI-(PL^3)/48EI so to minimize the deflection we must maximize E and I. E is given to us by assuming Rolled Steel as the material. After assuming a weightless beam, we can directly solve for I using the max deflection to be 0.03m (2% length) and get that it must exceed 6.89 10^6 so to play it safe, I chose W150x18 cross section to account for the beam's weight which should not be too much of a factor. The weight distribution is also maximized in this layout over something like a circular or rectangular cross section.
