<h1><b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b></h1>

Spotted lantern flies reproduce at an extremely rapid rate (with one adult female laying up to 3 egg masses in her lifetime, each containing 30-60 eggs), allowing their population to grow exponentially within a single season. SLFs feed on sap, weaken vines, reduce cold hardiness, and can cause plant death.<br>

<b>Impact:</b> By focusing on reducing their ability to reproduce, we can ensure that there will be fewer SLFs to cause harm to grape vines, satisfying our clients. Our product could also be used outside of the vineyards, as SLFs lay eggs almost anywhere. Developing a selective solution allows us to create a scalable model that can be implemented; by having a larger user base, we can make more of an impact on the SLF population, targeting and removing egg masses which are the root source of the infestation!<br>

<h2><b>Concept A: Radial Compression Mechanism</b></h2>

A mechanical tool designed to destroy egg masses directly on grapevines without damaging the plant. The device consists of a circular frame with a slit that surrounds the vine and positions a set of radially arranged claws around the egg mass. These claws are connected to a manual lever mechanism that converts the input force into inward radial motion. As the lever is pulled, the claws close uniformly around the egg mass, applying compressive force sufficient to crush and destroy the eggs.<br>

<h3><b>Risks</b></h3>

- <b>Risk of damaging vine:</b> If excessive compressive force is applied to the vine it could damage or break the vine.<br>
- <b>Repeated compressions around the same spot:</b> Can behave like a clamp and create ring damage.<br>
- <b>Incomplete egg mass destruction:</b> If the lever doesn't generate enough force, the mechanism may not have the strength to destroy the egg mass.<br>

<h3><b>Risk Mitigation</b></h3>

Figuring out the force threshold needed to destroy the egg masses while leaving the vines undamaged, so the egg masses can be destroyed without harming the plant.<br>

<h2><b>Concept B: Mold Mechanism</b></h2>

This mechanism uses a mold made of many small needles mounted on a flexible backing. Each needle can move independently, allowing the mold to change shape and conform to uneven surfaces such as vines, branches, and tree bark. When the mold is pressed onto a surface, the needles shift by different amounts to match the local geometry.<br>

As pressure is applied, the needles collectively apply enough force to break apart and crush spotted lantern fly egg masses, even when they are located on curved or irregular surfaces. Compared to a traditional claw or rigid gripper, this design does not require precise alignment and can automatically adapt to different branch sizes and shapes. This makes the mechanism more versatile and usable across many situations without requiring modification.<br>

<h3><b>Risk & Mitigation</b></h3>

- There is risk of the mechanism not conforming to certain larger surfaces such as a tree trunk, but this could potentially be solved by allowing for different configurations of our mechanism.<br>
- It would be hard to tell if all the egg masses are destroyed or not and wouldn’t allow for easily disposing of the egg masses.<br>
- There could be insufficient force for certain parts of the vine/branch to crush the egg masses but this could be avoided through sufficient prototyping of our mechanism.<br>

<h2><b>General Key Risks (technical, usability, adoption, constraints)</b></h2>

- Given the short time window between egg laying and hatching, it becomes difficult to remove enough egg masses to meaningfully slow population growth.<br>
- Risk of damaging vines during egg removal.<br>
- Risks that eggs are not properly destroyed; egg masses can hatch even if scraped off the plant, so proper disposal is critical.<br>

<h2><b>Questions for the Client</b></h2>

1. Is crushing the egg mass sufficient, or must it be fully removed and disposed of?<br>
2. During what season are the egg masses removed?<br>
3. If crushing the egg mass is sufficient, how much force is required to destroy them?<br>
4. How tall are average grapevines, and can an average worker reach the required height?<br>
5. Where are egg clusters typically found on a grapevine?<br>
6. Are adult spotted lantern flies actually more attracted to the Tree of Heaven compared to grapevines?<br>
