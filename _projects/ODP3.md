<h1><b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b></h1>

**Team:** Sorry Little Fly  
**Clients:** Cornell CALS Extension, E&J Gallo Winery, and National Grape  

<h2><b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b></h2>
Spotted lantern flies reproduce at an extremely rapid rate, with one adult female laying up to 3 egg masses in her lifetime, each containing 30–60 eggs, allowing exponential population growth within a single season. SLFs feed on sap, weaken vines, reduce cold hardiness, and can potentially cause vine death. Current removal methods are inconsistent, labor-intensive, and risk damaging vines, making it difficult to reliably reduce infestations.  

<h2><b>IMPACT</b></h2>
By focusing on destroying egg masses, fewer SLFs reach adulthood, reducing damage to grape vines and protecting yield. Our solution could be used beyond vineyards, as SLFs lay eggs on many surfaces. By enabling plant-safe, effective removal, a larger user base can tackle the root of infestations, maximizing impact on the population.  

<h2><b>PROPOSED DIRECTIONS</b></h2>

<b>Concept A: Radial Compression Mechanism</b><br>
A mechanical tool designed to crush egg masses directly on grapevines without damaging the plant. The device has a circular frame with a slit that surrounds the vine and radially arranged claws around the egg mass. A manual lever converts input force into inward radial motion, uniformly crushing the eggs when pulled.  

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- **Risk of vine damage:** Excessive force can harm or break the vine; repeated compressions could create ring damage. Mitigation: Test force thresholds to ensure eggs are destroyed safely.  
- **Incomplete egg destruction:** Lever may not generate enough force. Mitigation: Prototype testing with mock egg masses ensures effectiveness.

<b>Concept B: Adaptive Needle Mold Mechanism</b><br>
A flexible mold with many small, independently moving needles that conform to uneven surfaces like vines, branches, or bark. When pressed, the needles distribute force evenly to crush egg masses, even on curved or irregular surfaces. This design does not require precise alignment and adapts automatically to branch geometry.  

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- **Surface limitations:** May not conform to large surfaces like tree trunks; mitigated by configurable mold sizes.  
- **Incomplete egg destruction:** Hard to visually confirm all eggs crushed; mitigated by testing and prototyping.  
- **Force limitations:** Certain parts of a branch may not get enough pressure; mitigated through sufficient prototyping.  

---

<b>Concept C: Decoy Tree of Heaven</b><br>
A decoy mimicking the preferred Tree of Heaven, equipped with an automated scraping mechanism. Egg masses laid on the decoy are scraped into a pool of alcohol at the base, ensuring eggs are destroyed.  

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- **Impact on native insects:** Could unintentionally attract or harm other species; mitigated by careful placement and testing.  
- **Mechanical failure:** Automated scraping could malfunction; mitigated through robust design and maintainable components.  
- **Incomplete egg capture:** Scraped eggs may miss the alcohol pool; mitigated with nets or guides.

<h2><b>GENERAL KEY RISKS</b></h2>
- Timing between egg laying and hatching may reduce the number of eggs removed, limiting population control.  
- Damaging vines during removal.  
- Improperly destroyed eggs could hatch if scraped to the ground; all concepts require safe disposal.  

<h2><b>QUESTIONS FOR THE CLIENT</b></h2>
1. Is crushing the egg mass sufficient, or must it be fully removed and disposed of?  
2. During what season are egg masses removed?  
3. If crushing is sufficient, how much force is required to destroy them?  
4. How tall are average grapevines, and can an average worker reach them?  
5. Where are egg clusters most commonly located on a grapevine?  
6. Are adult spotted lantern flies more attracted to the Tree of Heaven compared to grapevines?

**Notes from research:**  
- Egg masses may be squashed, scraped into soapy water or rubbing alcohol, or treated with horticultural oils.  
- Eggs are laid late summer through early winter (majority in October).  
- Each egg mass contains 30–50 eggs; a female can lay at least 2 egg masses.  
- Dimensions: ~1.5 in long, brown/grey, with rows of small eggs.  
- Scraped eggs can still hatch; care is needed for full destruction.  
- Only 2% of egg masses are within reach; 98% are out of reach.
