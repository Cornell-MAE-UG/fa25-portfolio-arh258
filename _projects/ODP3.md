# Project Title: Stopping Little Flies  
**Team Name:** Sorry Little Fly  
**Clients:** Cornell CALS Extension, E&J Gallo Winery, and National Grape  

---

## Problem Statement  
Spotted lantern flies reproduce at an extremely rapid rate (with one adult female laying up to 3 egg masses in her lifetime, each containing 30–60 eggs) allowing their population to grow exponentially within a single season. SLFs feed on sap, weaken vines, reduce cold hardiness, and can cause plant death.

---

## Impact  
By focusing on reducing their ability to reproduce, we can ensure fewer SLFs harm grapevines, satisfying our clients. Our product could also be used outside vineyards, as SLFs lay eggs nearly anywhere. Developing a selective solution creates a scalable model; with a larger user base, we can better tackle the root source of infestations by targeting and removing egg masses.

## Proposed Direction  

### Concept A: Radial Compression Mechanism  
A mechanical tool designed to destroy egg masses directly on grapevines without damaging the plant. The device consists of a circular frame with a slit that surrounds the vine and positions radially arranged claws around the egg mass. These claws connect to a manual lever mechanism that converts input force into inward radial motion. As the lever is pulled, claws close uniformly around the egg mass, applying compressive force sufficient to crush and destroy the eggs.

**Risks:**  
- Risk of damaging vine: Excessive force could damage or break the vine.  
- Repeated compressions around the same spot may behave like a clamp, creating ring damage.  
- Incomplete eggmass destruction: Insufficient lever force might fail to destroy the eggmass.

**Risk Mitigation:**  
Figuring out the force threshold needed to destroy egg masses without harming vines, ensuring effective and safe operation.

### Concept B: Mold Mechanism  
This mechanism uses a mold of many small needles mounted on a flexible backing. Each needle moves independently to conform to uneven surfaces such as vines, branches, or bark. When pressed, needles shift to match local geometry. Applied pressure crushes egg masses, even on curved or irregular surfaces. Compared to rigid claws or grippers, this design requires no precise alignment and adapts automatically to branch size and shape, increasing versatility without modification.

**Risks & Mitigation:**  
- May not conform to large surfaces like tree trunks — adjustable configurations could solve this.  
- Difficulty verifying complete egg destruction and disposing of egg masses.  
- Insufficient force in some areas could be avoided by thorough prototyping.

---

## General Key Risks (technical, usability, adoption, constraints)  
- Time constraints between egg laying and hatching make removal challenging to slow population growth meaningfully.  
- Potential damage to vines.  
- Risk that eggs not properly destroyed may hatch even if scraped off, so disposal is critical.

## Questions for the Client  
1. Is crushing the egg mass sufficient, or must it be fully removed and disposed of?  
2. During what season are the egg masses typically removed?  
3. If crushing is sufficient, how much force is required to reliably destroy eggs?  
4. How tall are average grapevines, and can an average worker reach the required height?  
5. Where are egg clusters most commonly located on a grapevine?  
6. Are adult spotted lantern flies more attracted to the Tree of Heaven compared to grapevines?
