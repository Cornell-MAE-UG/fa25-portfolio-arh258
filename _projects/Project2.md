<b>PROJECT OVERVIEW</b>

This project was an assignment in my Thermodynamics class by which we applied our in class skills regarding device analysis to a real world instance of one of these devices. My group and I selected the Ossberger Crossflow G1078/20g (2 cell) —hydroturbine on Beebe/Fall Creek. I worked with James Larrabee, Annika Terezakis, and Andrew Nocily on this project; we did the whole thing entirely as a collective so our websites will essentially match.

<b> THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS</b>
Physical Description: The plant uses two Ossberger cross-flow turbines: we chose to analyze the second unit listed on the Cornell Facilities page, named the “Crossflow G1078/20g (2 cell)”. In these types of system, water typically flows in from a body of water and passes through an inlet guides. These regulate flow rate and direct the water across the turbine’s blades twice, hence the “cross-flow” name, maximizing the amount of energy that can be harnessed. Water finally exits on the opposite side and is free to continue through the waterway. A benefit of crossflow turbines is that they operate at a variety of flows adequately and their efficiency remains relatively constant over a wide range of inputs, which is ideal for small river applications like this one where flow is far from constant under the variable weather conditions of Ithaca.
